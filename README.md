1. A working Python environment (see next session) 
2. Access to the HPC of the Uni Oldenburg
3. Be part of the agamt group on the HPC (to access the used data)


## Python

### Setup and check your workflow

The work is conducted in Python 3.11.4, using pyenv to setup the environment

#### Setup on local machine


#### Setup on the HPC
